fwd_r = fwd_q[:]*np.cos(2*np.pi*times) + fwd_i[:]*np.sin(2*np.pi*times)
fwd_r_fft = scipy.fft.fft(fwd_r)
freq_fwd = scipy.fft.fftfreq(np.size(times), 44.44e-6)


trans_r = trans_q*np.cos(2*np.pi*times) + trans_i*np.sin(2*np.pi*times)
trans_fft = scipy.fft.fft(trans_r)
freq_trans = scipy.fft.fftfreq(np.size(times), 44.44e-6)



I need to create a file sniffer that will look for fwd_q and fwd_i files continuously and will add it to the fft calculations I guess this should be done in a thread
If upsampling required, it will be done here



I need to verify the number 44.44e-6 just to confirm it, I don't remember the calculation that went into that. '
